# Scalability Discussion

To scale this inventory management application for a larger audience, several strategies can be implemented:

## 1. Database Optimization and Sharding
- Use database sharding to distribute data across multiple database instances based on user ID or product owner.
- Implement read replicas for read-heavy operations like product listings.
- Optimize queries with proper indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., owner_id, created_at).

## 2. Caching Layer
- Introduce Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as product lists and user sessions.
- Cache API responses for pagination results to reduce database load.
- Cache scraped product data to reduce scraping frequency and improve response times.

## 3. Microservices Architecture
- Break down the monolithic backend into microservices (e.g., auth service, product service, stock movement service).
- Use asynchronous communication with message queues like RabbitMQ for stock movements.
- Consider a separate microservice for scraped products to handle scraping and storage asynchronously.

## 4. Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling
- Deploy multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer (e.g., NGINX or AWS ALB).
- Use container orchestration with Kubernetes for auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage.

## 5. CDN for Static Assets
- Serve frontend assets via a CDN to reduce latency for global users.

## 6. Scalability for Scraped Products
- Implement asynchronous scraping jobs to avoid blocking API requests.
- Use caching and rate limiting to manage scraping frequency.
- Store scraped data in a separate database or schema to isolate load.
- Paginate and index scraped product queries for efficient retrieval.

## 7. Scalability for User-Warehouse Assignments
- Optimize queries for user-warehouse relationships with proper indexing.
- Use batch processing for bulk assignments or removals.
- Cache frequent assignment lookups to reduce database hits.
- Monitor and limit assignment operations to prevent abuse.

These strategies would help handle increased traffic, improve performance, and ensure high availability.
